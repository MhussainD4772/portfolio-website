## 🔧 Technologies Used

### 🌐 Frontend Technologies
- **React.js** 🛠️: The core framework used for building this dynamic user interface. React allowed me to implement reusable components, smooth navigation, and interactive features.
- **Tailwind CSS** 🌟: A utility-first CSS framework used for designing a clean, responsive, and modern layout.
- **Vite** ✨: The next-generation build tool used for fast development and optimized production builds.
- **React Router** 📍: Used to implement smooth navigation between different sections of the portfolio.
- **React Icons** 🎨: A library to include scalable, customizable icons in the project.
- **React Scroll** 🛋️: Smooth scrolling and navigation between sections like Experience, Education, Projects, etc.

### 💻 Design & Development Tools
- **Visual Studio Code** ⚒️: My preferred code editor, enhanced with essential extensions and theming.
- **Figma** 🖌️: Used to design the initial UI wireframes and layout of the project.
- **Git & GitHub** 💎: For version control, collaboration, and deployment.
- **Vercel** 🚀: The project is hosted and deployed on Vercel using continuous deployment.
