🌟 Mohammed Hussain's Portfolio Website 🚀
Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project showcases my journey and expertise as a QA Automation Engineer, Software Enthusiast, and Python Learner. Built using modern technologies, this website serves as a dynamic and visually stunning portfolio to display my skills, projects, experience, and educational background.

🛠️ Technologies Used 🔧
Frontend Technologies ⚡
React.js ⚛️: The core framework used for building this dynamic user interface. React allowed me to implement reusable components, smooth navigation, and interactive features.

Tailwind CSS 🎨: A utility-first CSS framework used for designing a clean, responsive, and modern layout. Tailwind made it super easy to implement responsive designs with minimal CSS code.

Vite ⚡: The next-generation build tool used for fast development and optimized production builds. Vite provided faster hot-reloading during development, enabling a smooth coding experience.

React Router 🔗: Used to implement smooth navigation between the different sections of the portfolio (like Experience, Education, Projects).

React Icons 🖼️: A library to include scalable, customizable icons in the project.

React Scroll 🌀: Smooth scrolling and navigation between sections like Experience, Education, Projects, and more.

Backend (Not Implemented) 🛠️
No backend: This is a simple frontend-only portfolio website. The data and content are static, serving as an online resume.

Design Tools 🎨
VS Code 💻: My code editor of choice for writing all the code. It offers an excellent development environment with tons of extensions to speed up the coding process.

Figma 🖌️: Used to design the initial UI wireframes and UX layout, ensuring an intuitive and beautiful interface.

Version Control 🗂️
Git & GitHub 🦑: Used for version control and tracking changes throughout the project. GitHub also serves as the remote repository for hosting and collaboration.

Deployment 🌐
Vercel 🚀: Hosted and deployed using Vercel, which automatically deploys the project whenever changes are pushed to the GitHub repository.
