- **React Icons** 🎨: A library to include scalable, customizable icons in the project.
- **React Scroll** 🛋️: Smooth scrolling and navigation between sections like Experience, Education, Projects, etc.

### 💻 Design & Development Tools
- **Visual Studio Code** ⚒️: My preferred code editor, enhanced with essential extensions and theming.
- **Figma** 🖌️: Used to design the initial UI wireframes and layout of the project.
- **Git & GitHub** 💎: For version control, collaboration, and deployment.
- **Vercel** 🚀: The project is hosted and deployed on Vercel using continuous deployment.
